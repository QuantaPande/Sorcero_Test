# Sorcero_Test

This git repository contains my submission for the Sorcero Coding challenge.

The code is in the notebook titled Sorcero_Test

The dependancies are:

1. ```numpy (v1.15.4)```
2. ```tqdm (v4.35.0)```

The code also depends on the GloVe word embeddings. I have used the Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 embeddings. These are NOT included in the git repository, but must be downloaded externally from : https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe
